        <p>Social media is a kind of technology that involves using computer programs to help people communicate and interact. It’s made up of several parts of code that work together to make everything run smoothly. These different sections of code each have a specific role in the program, allowing it to work properly. Social media allows users to share information with each other in many different ways, like through direct messages, group chats, voice calls, and video calls. It also helps people connect with others across the world, and it’s become a huge part of daily life for many people, especially teens. Through social media, users can post updates, share photos, and even interact with celebrities or influencers, changing the way we communicate and stay in touch with each other.</p>
